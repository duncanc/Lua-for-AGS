Complications
=============
- The editor plugin is ILMerged with ZLib.NET and Scintilla.NET, as a post-compile action
	- ILMerge: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=17630
	- ZLib.NET: http://www.componentace.com/zlib_.NET.htm
- Several of the runtime plugin files are generated, rather than handwritten, by a Lua script that uses information about the object types, function signatures etc. to create a whole lot of repetitive boilerplate code
