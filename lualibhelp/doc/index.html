		<h1>Lua Library Helper</h1>
		<hr />
		<h2>Rationale</h2>
		<p>
			Lua Library Helper is a C header for developing custom-designed C/C++ bindings.
			("Custom-designed" is as opposed to automatically-generated bindings such as with tools like tolua++.)
			It aims to make some powerful patterns easy and quick to reuse without sacrificing performance, or ending up with a lot of longwinded repetitive code.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Mutable Values</h3>
		<p>
			Say that you want to share an upvalue between several C functions, and whenever any of those functions change the value of the upvalue it should be changed
			for all functions with that upvalue, not just the one that changed it. The most likely recommendation is to choose a suitable key (maybe a light userdata) to
			store this value in the registry instead of using an upvalue.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lua Library Helper includes an alternate method which involves creating a "mutable"
			and using custom functions to get and set the value that it holds.
			(Internally, a mutable is simply a table.)
		</p>
		<h3>llh_newmutable (L)</h3>
		<p>
			Create a new mutable value and push it onto the stack.
		</p>
		<h3>llh_pushmutablevalue (L, idx)</h3>
		<p>
			Retrieve the value from the mutable at the given index.
		</p>
		<h3>llh_replacemutablevalue (L, idx)</h3>
		<p>
			Pop the top value from the stack and set it as the value of the mutable at the given index.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Integer Constants</h2>
		<hr />
		<h2>Converting between Structs and Tables</h2>
		<p>
			
		</p>
		<h3>llh_struct2table_number (L, pstruct, <i>propname</i>)</h3>
		<p>
			Pushes the number value found in the <b><i>(propname)</i></b> field of the struct pointed to by typed pointer <b>pstruct</b>, and sets it
			as a field of the table on the top of the stack.
		</p>
		<p>
			(Note that <b><i>propname</i></b> should <i>not</i> be a string, but passed unquoted as if it were a variable name.)
		</p>
		<h3>llh_struct2table_lightuserdata (L, pstruct, <i>propname</i>)</h3>
		<p>
			Similar to <tt>llh_struct2table_number</tt>, except instead of being cast to a <tt>lua_Number</tt> and pushed as a number,
			the given field is cast to a <tt>void*</tt> pointer and pushed as a light userdata.
		</p>
		<h3>llh_struct2table_boolean (L, pstruct, <i>propname</i>)</h3>
		<p>
			Similar to <tt>llh_struct2table_number</tt>, except the field is cast to an integer and is pushed as either <tt>false</tt> if
			the cast value is zero or <tt>true</tt> otherwise.
		</p>
		<h3>llh_struct2table_numarray (L, pstruct, <i>propname</i>, length)</h3>
		<p>
			Similar to <tt>llh_struct2table_number</tt>, except the field is expected to be a fixed array of numbers. It is pushed
			as a Lua array table (one-based).
		</p>
		<h3>llh_table2struct_checknumber (L, idx, pstruct, <i>propname</i>, <i>NUM_TYPE</i>)</h3>
		<p>
			The field <b><i>(propname)</i></b> is fetched from the table at the given index <b>idx</b>.
			If this value is not a number, an error is raised.
			Otherwise, the number is cast to <b><i>(NUM_TYPE)</i></b> and assigned to the <b><i>(propname)</i></b> field
			of the struct pointed to by typed pointer <b>pstruct</b>.
		</p>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<p>
			Say that we have a struct:
		</p>
		<pre class='code'>
typedef struct FruitStock {
    int appleCount;
    int orangeCount;
    int bananaCount;
} FruitStock;
</pre>
		<p>
			In order to create a table containing this field, we could do:
		</p>
		<pre class='code'>
FruitStock fruit;
fruit.appleCount = 120;
fruit.orangeCount = 415;
fruit.bananaCount = 4;
lua_newtable(L);
llh_struct2table(L, &fruit, appleCount);
llh_struct2table(L, &fruit, orangeCount);
llh_struct2table(L, &fruit, bananaCount);
</pre>
		<hr />
		<h2>Absolute vs. Relative Indexing</h2>
		<p>
			Relative indices (e.g. <tt class='code'>-1</tt> to indicate the top value on the stack) are very useful for expressiveness but
			can be problematic if you are going to be manipulating the stack in complex ways inside the function/macro that is passed the
			index.
		</p>
		<h3>llh_isabsindex (L, idx)</h3>
		<p>
			Evaluates to <tt class='code'>1</tt> if the given index is absolute, <tt class='code'>0</tt> otherwise.
			(This is more complex than simply testing if it is negative, as the virtual indices are also negative.)
		</p>
		<h3>llh_toabsindex (L, idx)</h3>
		<p>
			Evaluates to an index guaranteed to be both absolute (i.e. not dependant on the size of the stack) and equivalent to the given index.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
		<p>
			These macros do not fit into any other section.
		</p>
		<h3>llh_iscallable (L, idx)</h3>
		<p>
			Evaluates to <tt class='code'>1</tt> if the value at the given index is either a function or has a <tt>__call</tt> metamethod, <tt class='code'>0</tt> otherwise.
		</p>
